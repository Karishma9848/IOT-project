# IOT based smart way of watering plants and feeding pets by using data analysis
Plants and animals are most important in our livelihood. Plants are useful for the oxygen 
purpose, stability of nature and needs of humankind. Pets are useful to decrease stress, anxiety, 
and loneliness. Like humans, they also need water and food to live. For forest animal’s nature 
provides all necessary conditions to live. But, for farming plants & animals, and indoor plants 
& pet animal’s humans have to take the responsibility to provide all necessary conditions 
including water and food. 
The main purpose of our project is to provide water for indoor plants and food for the 
pets when possessors go out for a noticeable duration of time. We are proposing an IoT-based 
smart automatic watering and feeding system for indoor plants and pets, respectively.
